Hi, I’m @matthewakrigg05, I am a first year Computer Science Student at Edge Hill University, near Liverpool, with ambitions of becoming a software engineer.

I’m interested in coding (obviously), football and music amongst various other things. My faviourite language so far is python as its the one that I am currently
the most familiar with, Middlesborough is the team that I support and my favourite bands are Green Day and Catfish and the Bottlemen. I also like to play games 
like Football Manager and Chess!

I’m currently learning to program in python and java through my university course. Currently the personal projects I am working on are written in 
python but in future I will be learning more about java and C# and building projects in those languages which I cannot wait for because I have so
many ideas already!

You can reach me on various media as listed below:
